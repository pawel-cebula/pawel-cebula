- 👋  Hi, I’m Pawel, a full-stack web developer based in Berlin, focusing on web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, React, MongoDB and PostgreSQL
- 👨‍  Before becoming a developer, I founded MEDIGO, where I was the COO and CCO for 7 years
- 💻  Along with my main stack, I'm always learning about new technologies and have recently been exploring TypeScript, GraphQL, Vue.js and TailwindCSS
- 🤔  Outside of coding, I like to go deep into a lot of things, most recently ramen, good coffee, craft beer and homebrewing, most things web3, HIIT, yoga and wakeboarding.
