- 👋  Hi, I’m Pawel, a Fullstack Software Engineer at [On Deck](https://www.beondeck.com/), where I'm building fundraising tools for early-stage founders
- 💻  I'm focusing on web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, React, Next.js, PostgreSQL and GraphQL
- 👨‍  Before becoming a developer, I founded MEDIGO, where I was the COO and CCO for 7 years
- 🤔  Outside of coding, I like to go deep into a lot of things, most recently ramen, good coffee, craft beer and homebrewing, most things web3, HIIT, yoga and wakeboarding.
